# Climbing the Mountain

Climbing Mt. Fuji is a rewarding hiking challenge. It is Japan's tallest
mountain. It is also one of Japan's holy mountains, so it has a lot of cultural
significance.

However, climbing it is not easy.

With the right preparation, it should be possible to climb it without much
discomfort.

# Preparation and Backpack Supplies

I will leave a list of supplies that I recommend that you get here. I will
describe in detail why you should get them later down below.

1. Snacks
2. Water
3. Garbage bag
4. Oxygen
5. 100 yen coins
6. Camera supplies
7. Face towel
8. Hat
9. Gloves
10. Headlamp and extra batteries
11. Eye mask and ear plugs
12. Toilet paper
13. Toothbrush

# The Plan

I'll outline a general plan here.

1. Get to the base camp
2. Ascend to the lodge
3. Summit
4. Descend back to base camp

First time climbers are recommended to take the Yoshida route, which is also the
same route that I took.

The first thing with the trip is to get to the base camp at the 5th Station via
bus. The hike proper starts after lunch. The ascent to the lodge will take up
the whole afternoon. Dinner and a good night's rest waits at the lodge. If
weather is good, the hike continues before dawn, in the darkness, with the goal
to reach the peak to catch the sunrise.

Breakfast takes place at the peak. There is a possibility to have a tour of the
crater at the peak. Descent follows, which takes up a few hours of the morning.
Changing out of climbing gear happens back at the base camp, and the bus to go
to a hotel resort should arrive not long after for a buffet lunch and a nice
bath in its onsen facilities.

# Get to the Base Camp

Getting to the base camp is the easy part. The problem is how to get on the bus.

### Book a Tour

What I did was to book a tour with a company called Sunshine Tours. They have a
website, with [a reservation page for the Yoshida route.](https://www.sunshinetour.co.jp/fuji/fuji2_tokyo_j.html)

There are various upgrade options to consider. There is an option to buy lunch
for the first day at a discounted price. There is also the option to buy a
larger seat in the bus. It is also possible to rent your equipment. Finally,
there is also an option to upgrade the buffet lunch into a sumptuous Japanese
feast.

The only upgrade option I recommend is to rent your equipment if you don't
already have a set of hiking gear.

Be sure to get to the bus stop on time, and the bus leaves early morning since
the trip from Tokyo to Shizuoka Prefecture takes a while.

In my case, I rode the bus at Yokohama Station. We made a stop near Shinjuku
Station first before we finally departed for Fuji.

### Bus Ride to Fuji

There will be a few stops along the way. The first will be at a rest stop. Take
this opportunity to stretch your legs and go to the bathroom. This rest will
not take long, so if you must eat, buy something you can take on the go. Don't
order a meal from the shops. Go to the convenience store section of the rest
stop and buy something there instead. I recommend that you take this opportunity
to buy lunch and eat it early.

The next stop will be at the rental shop. This is where you collect your rented
equipment. Be sure to check if your equipment fits since you can have it
exchanged for the proper size.

The bus will climb the winding road up to the 5th Station. When it stops, you
will be briefed on what will happen in the next hour. Take this time to go to
the lockers and change. Take this time to eat lunch as well, although the
cafeteria is likely to be crammed full of people. You might not get to eat if
you try to get food here. For this reason, I don't recommend reserving your
lunch ticket when you book the tour. The cafeteria staff will still need to cook
your food, after all, and if there will be dozens of people ahead of you with a
short-staffed cafeteria, you better eat early, or you won't get to eat at all.

In my case, I had to eat one of my meal replacement snacks that I packed for
this hike. Snacks like Calorie Mate would be perfect for this, but I was already
getting into supplies that I didn't want to touch before the ascent proper.

# Ascend to the Lodge

The ascent to the lodge takes place after lunch. Do be early to the assembly
place, which would be the square in the middle of the buildings at the 5th
Station.

Before ascending, however, you might be interested in purchasing a walking stick
from the shops. If you don't have trekking poles, I would recommend that you
get a walking stick. You could get one with a bell or one with a flag. However,
if you already have trekking poles, I suggest that you get a short stick from
the shops instead. This stick will be used to collect stamps during the ascent.

You will travel with the rest of your tour group to your lodge. There will be
two tour guides. One will be in front while the other will be at the back of
the group. The tour guides will also tie a small knot of colored rope on your
person, likely on your shoe, to identify you as part of the group.

The ascent will take hours. It will be early evening by the time you reach your
lodge. In my case, we lodged at the 8.5th Station, the last station before the
peak.

Make the most out of this time as you will spend hours on the trail. However,
you will likely rest at every lodge you come across. Since the Yoshida route
has the most number of lodges, you can rest often. Your tour guide might also
call for a rest even in the middle of the road, so you should really enjoy the
climb.

You need to rest frequently so that your body will be acclimated to the
altitude. The 5th Station is already 2,300 m above sea level, and you still need
to climb all the way to 3,776 m. You may start experiencing symptoms if you go
too quickly, so do take rests.

At the lodges, you will likely get the opportunity to buy a stamp for your
stick. Your stick will be branded with a hot iron, and there will be a beautiful
mark etched into the wooden surface. Some stamps cost 300 yen while others cost
500. It depends on the lodge, so ask before you spend.

The Yoshida route is a winding path. It is littered with pebbles and the
occasional rock path where you might crawl on all fours as you try to navigate
the rocky slope. You might have to constantly watch your step.

Higher up on the Yoshida route, on a clear day, you will be able to see
Lakes Kawaguchi and Yamanaka. You might even get to see Enoshima in the
distance.

You may also buy supplies at the lodges. It is possible to buy snacks and drinks
like cream bread and sports drinks. Of course, you can also dig into your
supplies. However, the lodges will take back the trash of the items you bought
from them. Consuming your own supplies means you have to bring your own trash
with you.

If you can, do make friends, although it might be hard if everyone else can
speak only Japanese.

One fun thing you might try is to try to hear your echo from the mountain. Ask
your tour guide on the correct way to project your voice. Ours told us of a folk
tale that monsters called Yamabiko lived on the mountain. The Yamabiko were said
to be responsible for the echo.

Even senior citizens came hiking with us. However, their advanced age has taken
away their former agility, so you can expect them to lag behind the rest of the
group. If your tour group has senior citizens, your tour guides may split the
group into two, and one of the tour guides will stay with the senior citizens so
they arrive at the lodge safely. You may travel with the senior citizens if you
prefer the slower pace.

It will be early evening by the time you get to the lodge at the 8.5th Station.
The sun will likely have set, but you will get to see the magnificent view as
the sun descends into the horizon on the other side of the mountain. You will
also get to see the shadow of the mountain behind you as you make the rest of
the way to the lodge.

### Falling Rocks and Safety

Rocks may fall during your ascent, however, so you should try to keep yourself
safe. There are rock shelters, so you can take refuge in these places.

It is also possible to rent a helmet during the ascent. The helmet will be
returned during the descent.

It is not necessary to rent a helmet, but if it makes you feel more comfortable,
you may. The deposit is 3,000 yen, and you will get it back after returning the
helmet. Be sure to take good care of the helmet as well since its condition will
be checked.

### Changing Weather Conditions

Mt. Fuji, by virtue of being a tall mountain, has its share of moody weather.
I recommend that you wear appropriate clothing in case of sudden heavy wind and
rain.

### Bullet Climbing

Bullet climbing is the term used to refer to climbing the mountain and coming
back down in a short span of time, usually in the same day. This is discouraged
as you might suffer from acute mountain sickness. Your body will need time
to adjust to the changes in altitude, and it needs to get used to the
ever-thinning air.

***If you feel incredibly uncomfortable during your climb due to mountain
sickness, consider abandoning the hike altogether.***

### Plants and Animals on the Trail

The trail is clearly defined. It has been cleared of plants, although you can
see some plants along the way. However, plant life will become more sparse the
higher up you go.

Animals don't normally appear on the trail as well, so you don't have to worry
about them. There is no need to bring bear countermeasures, for example.

Mosquitoes don't pose a particular threat, but you may apply mosquito repellent
if it makes you feel more comfortable.

# Summit

So, you've arrived at the lodge. You should eat heartily and sleep soundly.
Dinner is part of your reservation fee here at the lodge, so be sure to eat
everything in thanksgiving for being able to complete the difficult climb you've
had so far.

You will spend the night at the lodge. You should rest and relax. Before going
to sleep, you may connect to the lodge's WiFi connection. Look around for the
login details.

It might be a good idea to have an eye mask and some ear plugs as you try to
get a few hours of sleep. You will wake up roughly an hour before the dawn. Set
an alarm on your phone. Make sure you can wake up from it. You may set your
phone to vibrate to jolt you awake.

### Straight Shot to the Top

The sunrise is sometime at 4 am, so at 3 am, you will make preparations for the
last leg of the ascent. However, at this point, it is still pitch black. You
will have to continue the ascent in the dark. Part of your equipment should be
a headlamp, and it will be invaluable as you traverse the uneven road ahead.

However, if the weather is poor, you'll likely just rest for a few hours longer.
There isn't much point in catching the sunrise at the peak if you can't even see
it. It should be a moment of triumph, not a moment of shivering in the cold wind
and rain.

Unfortunately, poor weather came our way. Our guide asked us if we still wanted
to go to the peak. Most of us still wanted to go, so we got ready to leave
shortly before 6 am, when the sun had already risen behind the clouds. We had
some visibility now, so we didn't need to use our headlamps.

The "straight shot to the top" is going to be difficult. Even if you have an
hour to make the ascent, you want to hurry. If weather is good, then you want to
catch the sunrise. If weather is poor, then you want to catch your bus.

Since the 8.5th Station is the last one before the peak, your only choice is to
rest along the trail. The difficulty is compounded by any aches and soreness
acquired during the first day. As you approach the summit, the air should become
its thinnest, which would make things a lot more difficult as your lungs
struggle for breath.

Even if this last leg is only 900 m, you will feel like it's gone on for much
longer. Persist and persevere, for you will be rewarded with victory!

# Descend Back to Base Camp

At the peak, you will have a chance to take pictures.

You will also get the chance to tour the crater at the peak. However, your tour
guide will be the one to make the decision. Poor weather will guarantee that
you cannot tour the crater, so it would really be best if you could climb during
good weather.

Descent on the Yoshida route will be on a different trail from the one used for
the ascent. Descent won't be too hard, but you need to protect your ankles from
pebbles. Gaiters will be important in this part of the hike.

You won't be fighting gravity as much as you did during the ascent, so you
should be able to finish the descent in around two or three hours. You will
still pass by the helmet rental station, so this is where you will return your
helmet after use. You will then go back to the base camp afterward to change
back and return your rented equipment.

Congratulations! You've survived Mt. Fuji!

The bus will arrive and take you to a hotel resort. This ride will also take a
while, so you might consider taking a nap.

At the hotel resort, you will be given a bath towel. You may bathe first, but
you may also eat first. However, you won't have much time, so I suggest that
you take a nice soak in the onsen, but don't take too long, and then eat your
fill at the buffet.

You may also choose not to use the onsen facilities. This way, you can focus on
eating your fill from the buffet.

The bus will then take you to a souvenir shop near a temple. You may visit both.
You will also be given some coupons to reduce the cost of your purchases.

The bus will then make its way back to Tokyo. In my case, I alighted near
Shinjuku Station, and I then made my way back home using the trains.

# Important Points to Keep in Mind

### 1. Fitness

I would like to stress that fitness is crucial to enjoying the hike up Mt. Fuji.

There are two points for consideration.

The first is stamina. You'll be hiking for hours. Granted, you'll also take
breaks during the climb, but the ascent will not be quick. The most important
part about stamina would be the "straight shot to the top", as the pace is
quickened to make it in time. Rests are still possible, but you'll have to rest
in place rather than on a bench. It's usually the tour guide who calls for
rests, but even then, this last leg of the ascent is like the sprint compared
to the marathon of the first day.

The second is strength. You'll be bringing your pack for the entire trip. Sure,
you might be able to set down your pack during the rest periods, but your
shoulders should be able to carry the weight for an extended period of time. You
also cannot dispose of any garbage you brought up with you to the mountain, so
you have to take this into consideration. However, buying food and water on the
mountain is an acceptable alternative, and the shops will generally take back
the trash after you're done eating or drinking. It's just that food and water
will cost *much* more than they usually do in supermarkets.

Each day took around 20,000 steps, according to my pedometer. If you're not used
to walking that far, I suggest you start now.

### 2. Equipment

While there is an option to rent a set of climbing gear, it is also possible to
forego renting altogether and to bring your own equipment.

I just went with renting to make things easier for myself. In my case, I got
the seven piece set consisting of:

1. Rain wear (upper and lower)
2. Waterproof backpack
3. Mountain climbing shoes
4. Trekking poles
5. Headlamp
6. Gaiters
7. Fleece jacket

However, the key equipment to bring would be the first three things: rain wear,
waterproof backpack, and mountain climbing shoes.

If you intend to catch the sunrise, then you will also be climbing to the peak
in the darkness. A headlamp will also be important.

Gaiters will be important to shield your shoes from dirt and pebbles. This is
especially important during the descent.

A fleece jacket is primarily for the cold. Even though the climbing season is
right in the middle of the Japanese summer (late July to early September) when
it would be very hot in the city, it is cold on the mountain, especially higher
up. One of my companions even said that it was a parallel world.

It may be better to wear all items as you ascend. The only exception is the
headlamp. Keep this in your backpack until the straight shot to the top.

#### Trekking pole tips

Trekking poles are important if you know how to use them. If you don't, you can
leave them behind in the base camp. In fact, you can buy a walking stick. Mine
came with a flag. However, the same general principles apply to a walking
stick. Don't overreach to try to pull yourself forward, and keep your hands
below your chest.

Trying to reach too far forward to try to pull yourself forward means that you
will spend more energy than you would have if you didn't use the poles/stick.
Instead, treat the pole as an extra foot. If you have the pole in your right
hand, treat it as an extra right foot. When you try to take a step with your
left foot, plant the tip of the pole around the same place horizontally as your
left foot. Push backward on the pole so that you push yourself forward when you
try to take your next step with your right foot. Do the same thing with your
left trekking pole. Conserve energy this way.

Keep your hands below your chest, especially when you're using trekking poles.
The idea behind this is that you don't want your heart to have to work harder to
pump blood to your arm. When you're using trekking poles, this often results in
carrying the trekking pole "wizard style". You don't have a magic spell that
will reduce the strain on your body, so you have to conserve as much strength as
you can.

#### Backpack tips

The backpack will be one of the most crucial pieces of equipment you will use.
Its use might seem so simple, but you need to make sure that you're not
overlooking its utility. You will be using it to carry your equipment, of
course, but you will also make full use of its features to reduce the strain on
your shoulders.

Make full use of the hip belt. You do this by properly adjusting the straps, not
just those of the hip belt but also of the shoulder straps. However, put on
your backpack first and then secure the hip belt. Start adjusting your hip belt
so that it feels snug and secure against your hips.

The next point of adjustment would be for your shoulder straps. This is
important since your back should touch the back rest of your backpack. If it's
touching only part of the back rest, then your backpack is not properly aligned.
It means that the bag will sag, and your shoulders will hurt. The weight will
not be properly distributed to your hips via the hip belt. You should then pull
on the straps for your shoulders until you can feel that the back rest is
finally touching the entirety of your back. There's no point about the back
rest's ventilation features if your back isn't even touching it.

Your backpack shoulder straps might feel a bit tight at this point, so make sure
that you still feel comfortable. The last step is to adjust the chest strap. Its
job is not to bear weight, but it's to make sure that your shoulder straps
are aligned properly. You might feel that the chest strap will compress your
shoulder straps some more, but again, adjust it so that you feel comfortable.

If you don't have a backpack with a hip belt, I recommend that you borrow one
from the rental shop. I want to stress the importance of distributing weight
from your shoulders to your hips.

### 3. Backpack Contents

I recommend that you bring supplies with you. It is possible to climb the
mountain without your backpack supplies, but you could get hungry or thirsty.
Worse yet, you might suffer an injury, and a first aid kit would be helpful at
this point. However, your tour guide will likely keep a first aid kit on his
person, so you may choose not to bring your own first aid kit.

Bring snacks. I personally brought along three boxes of a meal replacement
snack. The most popular snack of this kind is Calorie Mate. Buy boxes of four
sticks, which would be obvious since the two-stick boxes are quite thin. The
four-stick boxes have dimensions that resemble a square.

The snacks you should bring should keep your hands dry and not sticky. There are
a lot of examples of snacks you can bring, like Snickers candy bars (or other
kinds of chocolate bars), trail mix, cookies, rice balls, bread, and sandwiches.

Your snacks might dry out your throat, so make sure to bring some water. You may
also bring sports drinks. You will be sweating, after all, and you need to
replenish your electrolytes. Calculate how much you will need for two days of
hiking and multiply that by around 1.5. In my case, I brought two liters of
sports drinks, and I was able to ration it out until my descent on the second
day. You may need more water or less water than I did. Use your best judgement.

Your water will likely be the heaviest thing you'll carry, so you will need to
make sure you can handle the weight.

Make sure you have a garbage bag into which you'll put your garbage. You may not
litter on the mountain.

You may also bring portable oxygen cans. You will be dealing with the thinning
air, so this might help alleviate acute mountain sickness. This might not be
necessary, but it's better safe than sorry.

You may also bring liquid oxygen or oxygen tablets in place of the oxygen can.
You just need to find where you can buy them.

Bring 100 yen coins as well. Keep these in a dedicated coin purse. You will use
these coins when using the toilet. Use of the toilet will require payment of 100
yen per use. This cost increases to 200 yen higher up the mountain. I think that
keeping 2,000 yen in 100 yen coins will be more than enough. I personally used
only 400 yen this way, but I think it was because I kept sweating that I barely
needed to use the bathroom.

You may bring a change of clothes, but from my experience, I don't recommend it.
Your clothes might get wet if water somehow gets into your pack, and that will
just weigh you down even more. This is especially true if your clothes are made
of cotton, so you might consider packing clothes of a different fabric,
especially clothes made for hiking. They should stay dry. I would rather
recommend that you leave your extra clothes at the base camp. Just change after
making it back to base camp.

Make sure to bring your camera supplies. In my case, I brought along my GoPro,
so I brought along extra batteries and an extra memory card. Be sure to store
them in securely.

You may bring a towel, but I recommend a face towel. A bath towel is just too
large, and it also runs the risk of weighing you down if water somehow gets into
your pack. Use the face towel to wipe away your sweat since it might irritate
your skin.

You may also bring sunscreen, but you might not need to since you might be all
bundled up in preparation for the falling temperatures. If you don't find
yourself outdoors all that often, I suggest just taking the sunshine in all its
glory so that your body can make use of the vitamin D, even though the only
place it can reach your skin might be your face.

You may bring a hat, but make sure to secure this with a cord. The wind may blow
it off your head, so your chin will catch the cord. However, your jacket hood
may serve a similar function.

You may also bring gloves to aid you as you get on your hands while you navigate
your way through slippery rock trails.

If you haven't already rented one, you should bring a headlamp. Be sure to bring
extra batteries.

An eye mask and ear plugs may be useful to help you get sleep at the lodge.

You may also bring some toilet paper in case the toilets run out.

For cleaning your teeth, you may bring only your toothbrush. Toothpaste has a
lot of chemicals which may be hazardous to the environment, so you will be
discouraged from brushing with toothpaste. You will rinse your mouth with your
own water supplies.

In summary, bring the following in your backpack:

1. Snacks
2. Water
3. Garbage bag
4. Oxygen
5. 100 yen coins
6. Camera supplies
7. Face towel
8. Hat
9. Gloves
10. Headlamp and extra batteries
11. Eye mask and ear plugs
12. Toilet paper
13. Toothbrush

### 4. Financial Costs

The tour package itself costs around 25,000 yen.

Renting the seven piece set costs around 10,000 yen.

The flag I bought cost 1,350 yen in itself. The stamps for my flag cost a total
of 4,000 yen, and this represented the heaviest additional cost. I'm sure that
I missed a few of the stamps along the Yoshida trail, so if I were to have
gotten all stamps, this cost would have been higher. You may forego collecting
stamps altogether, of course.

I paid 500 yen to use the coin locker at the base camp. This kept all my other
belongings safe while I was hiking. You may forego the use of a coin locker, but
you will have to bring all your belongings with you. You may not leave your
belongings in the bus.

I spent 400 yen to use the toilets.

I spent 1,000 yen on a donation for the preservation of Mt. Fuji. I was able to
get a little charm made with the wood from Mt. Fuji. This donation is completely
optional, so don't feel obligated to pay.

I spent 1,450 yen on snacks while I was on the mountain. To be specific, I spent
200 yen on a small cup of chai. A cream bun cost 300 yen. A cup of noodles cost
700 yen. The last 250 yen was on anpan, or a bun with azuki bean paste. I didn't
really buy water, although the water for the cup noodles might qualify.

The amount I spent on trains to get to the bus stop and back home was only 788
yen.

Reserving around 45,000 yen shouldn't be too bad. However, increase this amount
if you plan on buying more supplies than I did.

Don't forget to add 3,000 yen if you plan to rent a helmet. Even if you will get
this money back, you will still temporarily lose it.

|Item|Cost|
|---|---:|
|Base package|25,000|
|Equipment rental|10,000|
|Flag and stamps|5,350|
|Coin locker|500|
|Toilets|400|
|Donation|1,000|
|Snacks|1,450|
|Train trips|788|
|Total|44,488|

### 5. Schedule Considerations

If you have the freedom to choose your schedule, I recommend that you hike on a
weekday. This is to reduce the amount of people on the trail. As such, make sure
that the date that you choose isn't a Japanese holiday.

Again, you may only climb Mt. Fuji from late July to early September.

Also consider that your body will be sore after you complete the hike. If you
have to fly back home, take your fatigue into consideration.

It may be the case that the only thing you get to do in Japan is to climb
Mt. Fuji due to the soreness in your muscles, so keep this in mind when you
consider whether you should climb Mt. Fuji. This trip to Japan just might end up
being the "Fuji trip" if you don't get to do anything else on your itinerary.
